# Foundations.Assessment.BookshelfData

## Overview

*Flavor Text*  
The backend team has got our API up, the library data is flowing, and a sample of the book data is waiting for you on Github. Use it to begin building the frontend of our app, Bookshelf. We will be working on Bookshelf for the next few weeks, iterating on what you write today and adding features. Be sure to establish a good foundation by following OOP best practices and documenting your code so it will be easy to pick up again later. Submit a link to your Github repo and remember to use the help desk if you get stuck.

This assessment will test your ability to design classes that show a solid understanding of OOP best practices and build a small project given high level descriptions.

Refer to Canvas for more information as well as the rubric.
